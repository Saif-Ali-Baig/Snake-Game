# Snake Game Development Log

## Day 1: Getting Started with the Game Window  
**Date:** July 11, 2025

---

### 🛠️ Progress:
- Created a game window using **Java Swing** with a `JPanel`.
- Drew a grid with lines every 20 pixels to form a **400x400** play area.
- Placed a **green square** for the snake at position **(5,5)**.
- Placed a **red square** for the food at position **(10,10)**.
- Displayed the game window with the snake and food rendered.

---

### 🐛 Issues Found:
- Grid lines don’t fully align with the window edges.
- Used unclear variable names like `x`, `y`, `z`, making the code hard to understand.
- No comments in the code — forgot the purpose of `z = 400`.

---

### 🔧 Resolutions:
- Haven’t fixed the issues yet; focus was on visual output.
- Read some **Swing tutorials** to understand `JPanel` and `paintComponent`.

---

### 💡 Why I Started:
I love playing Snake on old phones and wanted to make my own version.  
Chose **Java** because it’s commonly used for desktop apps, and **Swing** looked like an easy way to start drawing graphics.

### ⏭️ Next Steps:
- Implement **arrow key** input to move the snake.
- Add a **timer** to make the snake move automatically.
